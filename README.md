# c00lgui
This script is a remake of the c00lgui made by c00lkidd.
This is a fanmade project and isn't actually made by c00lkidd.

This work's on almost all executor's if it doesn't i recommend using krnl.

You can open the GUI with the red arrow on the left side of your screen.
Also everything in this script is ClientSided, so no real harm is done.
